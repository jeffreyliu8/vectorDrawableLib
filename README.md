# vectorDrawableLib

Feel free to request, and I will try to create them for you. Provide svg or VectorDrawble.

All animations are under the res/drawable folder, avd_anim_xxxx.xml

Feel free to customize the speed, rotation angle, colors, etc.
To create reverse animation, just rotate the order of the valueFrom and valueTo values, and update the first drawable pathData.
